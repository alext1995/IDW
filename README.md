# Industrial Defects in the Wild - Anomaly Detection Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from:

Once unzipped, the dataset is in the same format as the well-known MVTec dataset, so should work with any code that uses MVTec. 

The dataset also works with the anomaly detection library VisionAD: https://github.com/alext1995/VisionAD, and the MultiCore algorithm: https://github.com/alext1995/MultiCore.
